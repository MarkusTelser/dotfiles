This is my personal `$HOME` configuration for nvim, which I partly stole and modified to my liking. Feel free to copy it for your own use (in exchange for a star, of course:wink:). The setup script was extensively tested and should work across all linux distros with apt-get or pacman as their package manager. My inspiration comes from the molokai & gruvbox theme. An almost autumn-like atmosphere is intended, for a warmer and cleaner workspace.

## Includes
- Tiling Window Manager (i3)
- Terminal (alacritty)
- Shell (bash & zsh)
- Editor (vim & nvim)
- Terminal Multiplexer (tmux)
- Others (aliases, dircolors, scripts)

## Setup
Make sure the scripts is executable with `chmod +x setup.sh`.  Excecute the script with root privileges and provide the `$HOME` path, like so:  `sudo ./setup.sh ~`. Then you select the modules you want or
otherwise you can manually copy/link the files. All overwritten files (that aren't symbolic links) get backed up into the folder `backup/`. Don't execute the script blindly, read it first.
